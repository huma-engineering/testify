# Testify Suite fork for the Parallel tests

This is a fork of [testify/suite][testify] for the Parallel tests support.

You should use the [testify][testify] if you don't need the parallel tests because this work is not meant to have continuous improvement.
It's as it is now, and I am satisfied with the current module.

## Thanks

- [testify][testify] contributors for a nice and lightweight test helper tools.
- Marcus Loo [maroux](https://github.com/maroux) for the contribution [Add support for parallel sub-tests and remove suite.Suite pseudo-interitance #1109](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/pull/1109)

Go code (golang) set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.

Features include:

* [Testing suite interfaces and functions](#suite-package)

Get started:

* Install testify with [one line of code](#installation), or [update it with another](#staying-up-to-date)
* For an introduction to writing test code in Go, see <http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing>
* Check out the API Documentation <http://godoc.org/github.com/huma-engineering/testify/v2>

## [`suite`](http://godoc.org/github.com/huma-engineering/testify/v2/suite "API documentation") package

The `suite` package provides functionality that you might be used to from more common object-oriented languages.  With it, you can build a testing suite as a struct, build setup/teardown methods and testing methods on your struct, and run them with 'go test' as per normal.

An example suite is shown below:

```go
// Basic imports
import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
    "github.com/huma-engineering/testify/v2/suite"
)

// Define the suite, which is simply a struct with all
// fields that tests need.
type ExampleTestSuite struct {
    VariableThatShouldStartAtFive int
}

// Make sure that VariableThatShouldStartAtFive is set to five
// before each test
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) SetupTest() {
    suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive = 5
}

// All methods that begin with "Test" are run as tests within a
// suite.
func (suite *ExampleTestSuite) TestExample(t *suite.T) {
    assert.Equal(t, 5, suite.VariableThatShouldStartAtFive)
}

// In order for 'go test' to run this suite, we need to create
// a normal test function and pass our suite to suite.Run
func TestExampleTestSuite(t *testing.T) {
    suite.Run(t, new(ExampleTestSuite))
}
```

For a more complete example, using all of the functionality provided by the suite package, look at our [example testing suite](https://github.com/huma-engineering/testify/v2/blob/master/suite/suite_test.go)

For more information on writing suites, check out the [API documentation for the `suite` package](http://godoc.org/github.com/huma-engineering/testify/v2/suite).

### Parallel Tests

This example [TestSuiteParallelSubTests](https://github.com/huma-engineering/testify/v2/blob/master/package_test.go) shows that [the issue with the parallel tests](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/issues/934) is solved.
You should see that TearDownTest waits until all parallel sub-tests finished.

```go
import (
  "testing"

  "github.com/huma-engineering/testify/v2/suite"
)

func TestSuiteParallelSubTests(t *testing.T) {
  suite.Run(t, &Suite{})
}

type Suite struct{}

func (s *Suite) TearDownSuite(t *suite.T) {
  t.Log(">> suite tear down")
}

func (s *Suite) TearDownTest(t *suite.T) {
  t.Log(">> single test tear down")
}

func (s *Suite) TestOne(t *suite.T) {
  for _, v := range []string{"sub1", "sub2", "sub3"} {
    t.Run(v, func(t *suite.T) {
      t.Parallel()
    })
  }
}

func (s *Suite) TestTwo(t *suite.T) {
  for _, v := range []string{"sub1", "sub2", "sub3"} {
    t.Run(v, func(t *suite.T) {
      t.Parallel()
    })
  }
}
```

The expected test output is below:

```sh
$ go test -v .
